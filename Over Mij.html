    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    
    <p class="text-block"> 
        I'm currently studying Software Development at ROC Mondriaan in the Hague. 
        This is my first year and I already learned different programming languages. 
        HTML, CSS and now I'm currently learning JavaScript. I got here by getting my certificate in high school. 
        I graduated from Christelijk Lyceum Delft and decided to go into the programming world after  
        talking to my brother who is also in this kind of work. 
        I started to investigate this course and decided that I wanted to do this education after thinking and practicing programming. <br>
        I found out that I love to code and know that I don't want to stop with just designing. 
        I want to expand my knowledge of programming. Even though I haven't accomplished the most 
        but I am still proud of everything I had to do to get into this college.
        I did accomplish to join this education after I made my exams. 
        I also accomplished to work together as a team and that really helped me over the years in group projects. 
        Not only have I learned to co-operate but also how to lead in a project with a group.
        I'm proud of the fact that I already learned the basics of coding while I didn't even know how it looked like a couple months ago.
        I would like to start a career as a programmer so I can use my creativity and skills 
        which I'm learning during this education and make or do something with it in the future.
        Besides everything with coding i also have other hobby's that i love.
        Those hobby's are: Hiking, climbing in the mountains, gaming, sports and doing outdoor activities with friends.
